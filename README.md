**AI & Robotics Systems Architect — Magnolia, Seattle, WA**
*Architect of the **Q Protocol** | Operator of the **Seattle Grid***

I build the connective tissue for deterministic agent intelligence. I specialize in collapsing complex AI stacks into coordinate-based orchestration layers, moving the industry from "Semantic Prompting" to "Latent Intent Execution."

### 🧠 The Core Logic: The Q Protocol
The **Q Protocol** is a high-density communication standard designed to reduce AI operational costs by 90%. By replacing expensive, ambiguous natural language with a structured **Hex-Coordinate Grid**, I enable autonomous systems to communicate with mathematical precision.

* **Logic isn't code; it's a coordinate.**
* **Intent isn't a prompt; it's a packet.**

### ◈ The Seattle Grid [Current State]

* **The Q-Kernel (0x000):** A universal runtime that routes semantic intent across a global grid. No container sprawl—one kernel, infinite agents.
* **Clair-Chat (0x400):** The executive interface for browser-use and real-time research orchestration.
* **Embodied Intelligence (Robotics):** Mapping the `0x900` range to physical actuators, eliminating semantic latency in robotic swarms.

### 📍 Seattle Identity & Discipline
I live in **Magnolia**, right across from Discovery Park. My engineering philosophy is shaped by the same discipline I find in my daily training at **TruFusion Ballard**:
- **Structure:** Every system needs a kernel.
- **Clarity:** Remove the semantic noise.
- **Repetition:** Refine the protocol until it's invisible.

Outside of the grid: Dad, husband, and **U12 girls soccer coach**. ⚽

### 🤝 Connect
If you are building in the Seattle AI ecosystem or working on high-density agent architectures, let’s talk. I am actively looking for collaborators who want to stop "prompting" and start **architecting**.
