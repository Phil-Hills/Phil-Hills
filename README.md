# 👋 Hi, I'm Phil Hills

**AI Systems Architect & Agentic Protocol Engineer — Magnolia, Seattle, WA**

I build the connective tissue around AI models — semantic memory systems, multi-agent orchestration layers, and structured protocols that make AI behavior predictable, reversible, and debuggable.

I maintain **180+ public repositories**, experimenting with memory formats, orchestration primitives, and AI-to-AI packet systems that evolve into the designs published on my site.

## 🧠 What I Work On

### **Semantic Memory Systems**
Reversible, structured memory layers that let agents carry state across workflows instead of relying on giant prompts.

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Controllers, routing logic, and execution rules (timeouts, retries, permissions) that coordinate specialized agents like a real system — not roleplay.

### **Protocol-First AI Design**
AI-to-AI packet formats, schemas, and descriptors (like my *DOMAIN | SEQUENCE | OUTCOME* pattern) that enable agent communication that is explicit and testable.

### **Large-Scale Data Workflows**
Compression, labeling, transformation, and reversible data formats for complex, multi-domain datasets.

If you’re interested in AI systems architecture, semantic memory, or agentic workflows, you’ll feel at home here.

## 🌲 Life in Seattle

I live in **Magnolia, Seattle**, right across from **Discovery Park** — easily one of the best reset buttons in the country.

Outside of engineering:

- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Dad & husband**  
- ⚽ **U12 girls soccer coach** (volunteer)  
- 🔥 **Daily training at TruFusion Ballard**  
  - hot pilates  
  - hot yoga  
  - strength conditioning  

Those routines keep me grounded, disciplined, and balanced, and they shape how I think about systems:  
**structure, repetition, clarity, and steady improvement.**

## 🧩 Open-Source Philosophy

Open-source is where I think out loud.

Most repos are snapshots of my reasoning process — trying new memory formats, new orchestration patterns, new packet designs, new agent behaviors.

Some ideas end up on my site as formal writeups.  
Most start right here as **experiments in code**.
